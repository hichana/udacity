library(tidyverse)
```

### 8.1 What is real?
In settings, turn off "Restore .RData into workspace at startup". Forces you to capture all important interactions in your code. 

### 8.2 Where does your analysis live?
Displayed at top of console. Or, check:
```{r}
getwd()
```

### 8.3
Relative paths preferred over absolute paths (to facilitate sharing).

### 8.4
For scripts, use RStudio's projects feature to manage where files are saved. Doing this will set the working directory and you can just use absolute paths in your project. Doing so will create an `.Rproj` file that you can open to get back to work.

### 9 Introduction
Wrangle phase includes Import > Tidy > Transform. It leads to the "Understand" phase which includes Transform(more if needed) > Visualize > Model. Finally you "Communicate" the results.
