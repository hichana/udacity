    "* A **'node'** element essentially represents a latitude/longitude coordinate. It may have 'tag' child elements with other data points indicating things like an 'address' or a 'school'.\n",
    "* A **'way'** element has nodes as children (with their element type shortened to 'nd'). It defines things like roads, buildings, natural areas, etc. It also may have 'tag' children for the same reasons as a node.\n",
    "* A **'relation'** has nested 'member' elements which reference existing ways and nodes. It defines logical or geographic relationships between other elements such as an extended hiking trail made up by a number of way elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "The osm file unzips to a whopping 1.28gb and crashes both Atom and SublimeText on my machine. [VIM](http://www.vim.org/), on the other hand, is a wonderfully simple text editor designed to be used in a bare-bones command line interface (like the Terminal app on a mac). It can easily handle the job. I opened the file with VIM and used a few basic VIM commands to jump around and explore the osm file freely:\n",
    "* Jump to bottom: `shift+g`\n",
    "* Jump to top: `gg`\n",
    "* page down: `Control+d`\n",
    "* page up: `Control+u`\n",
    "* Jump five million lines down (or any number of lines you want): type `5000000` and then hit `j`\n",
    "* Jump five million lines up: type `5000000` and then hit `k`\n",
    "* Search the entire massive file for anything you want: type `/` followed by your search\n",
    "* Go to the next instance of what you searched for: `n`\n",

    "*Side note: check out [this little gem](https://vim-adventures.com/) if you are interested in getting started with VIM in a fun way.*\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is what I learned from exploring the file:\n",
    "* The file has the standard opening:  <?xml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'?>. This was used in the script to make a sample, smaller file size, osm file.\n",
    "* The XML root element is 'osm' and is parent to all other elements.\n",
    "* There are 16,082,009 lines in total - wow!\n",

From what I understand about OpenStreetMap, this should also be where a lot of user-generated/added content is stored. I'll probably have to parse entire elements (node, way, relation) in order to create a well-structured database of the data, but the focus of my cleaning should be in the way tags. \n",

    "One other thing catches my eye - the large number of tag elements who's 'k' attribute contains the acronym 'NHD'. What is that about? It turns out NHD stands for the US Geological Survey's ['National Hydrography Dataset'](https://nhd.usgs.gov/), which maps out and documents the nation's watershed boundaries and their features. New Orleans is surrounded by a massive amount of such natural features. These will be among the first to go as ocean levels rise, and in my opinion it's worth knowing about it. This is my focus - the New Orleans watershed:\n",

    "The 'Model Changes' section of the NHD data model notes, \"ComID field deleted from all feature classes/tables\". It turns out that it has been replaced by a different field called 'Permanent\\_Identifier' as its unique identifier. The NHD data dictionary clarifies - \"features already assigned a ComID retain that value as the Permanent\\_Identifier\". While this is an important note for future data entry, it will not require cleaning here.\n",

Indeed, both 'FTYPE' and 'FType' refer to the same category of things - 'SwampMarsh', 'StreamRiver', etc. According to the NHD data model, 'FType' is the correct way to refer to this feature.\n",

    "To fix (clean) this and anything else I may come across in this case study, I created a non-executable python file called [**fix_dict.py**](https://github.com/rancherobeans/udacity/blob/master/P3/PROJECT/supporting_files/scripts/fix_dict.py) (`supporting_files/scripts`) that will be invoked in a later script that will parse the data. The basic algorithm of this file is very simple:\n",

    "2. Iterate over the nested dictionary to find the key or value that matches what I need to fix\n",
    "3. Overwrite data with the fix\n",
    "\n",
    "##### NHD:GNIS_ID\n",
    "'GNIS' stands for the '[Geographic Names Information System](https://nhd.usgs.gov/gnis.html)', which is another data set of natural feature identifiers from the U.S. Geological Survey:\n",

Someone with the appropriate permissions with the OpenStreetMap project can take action based on that.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### NHD:Permanent_\n",
    "This field most certainly refers to the NHD data model field 'Permanent_Identifier'. It seems to always share the save value as 'NHD:ComID'. This is another example where I'm not able to decide which is most appropriate, but I can use an SQL query to flag all instances for the OpenStreetMap project. \n",

    "##### NHD:RESOLUTION\n",
    "This is something I can fix using my [**fix_dict.py**](https://github.com/rancherobeans/udacity/blob/master/P3/PROJECT/supporting_files/scripts/fix_dict.py) file. According to the NHD data model it should be 'Resolution' (capital R and lowercase remaining letters). While this seems minor, it still fulfills my goal to make the data more accurate and consistent.\n",

    "This confused me at first as 'way_id' is not an official field in the NHD data model. I soon noticed that tags with this key have the same value as 'NHD:ComID'. This one seems not only redundant but misleading because its value has nothing to do with the id attribute for the parent way tag. As with the other redundancies, I'll use SQL to flag them for the OpenStreetMap project.\n",

    "OK, I'm focusing on NHD data but I don't want to omit the other tag elements while I have the opportunity to easily examine them. Yet, there isn't an official source I can use to verify they are valid, accurate or complete. My best bet is to manually review them and use my best judgement.

As the barrier islands disintegrate, the vast system of sheltered wetlands along Louisiana's delta plains are exposed to the full force and effects of open marine processes such as wave action, salinity intrusion, storm surge, tidal currents, and sediment transport that combine to accelerate wetlands deterioration.\""

According to [GeoFabrik](http://download.geofabrik.de/north-america.html), the United States downloaded as a **compressed** osm file is an approximately 12.4gb file! As a rough comparison, consider the the area I used in the case study is an 81.7mb file. Uncompressed it baloons to 1.28 gigabyte. This expansion by a factor of approximately 15.6 means that even if the redundant data constitutes just 0.25 percent of the whole dataset of the United States, there may be savings of around 4gb of uncompressed data!!!

This would, however, be something a careful data analyst would test for while conducting the database cleaning. Additionally, contacting the US Geological Survey's support service would be advisable. There may be a reason for an element to have multiple ComID for example, but one cannot be certain until simple yet practical things like asking around are carried out. I actually contacted the support staff at nhd@usgs.gov while conducting this case study to confirm that `Permanent_Identifier` is indeed the new primary key in the NHD dataset (where ComID was the prior one)."

    "This study moved from getting to know the data, auditing it, parsing/cleaning the data, learning from it using SQL queries and finally to suggesting some improvements. It was all conducted within the context of New Orleans and the quantified natural features we may lose within the next 100 years due to global warming. I encourage anyone to download this GitHub repository and run the project locally. Please also feel free to send me a pull request with any changes you think may be valuable."
